/**
 * @brief A base class for all oscillators
 * 
 * This class is the base class for all oscillators.
 * This class offers no real functionality, but is
 * used for identifying oscillators.
 *
 * By default, we pull the initial frequencies from the
 * module info object, if provided.
 * However, the frequency (among other things)
 * can be defined by the user.
 * 
 * Optionally, the frequency can be defined by the user in hertz
 * (see TODO: WRITE THIS for help getting this value).
 * The sample rate can also be defined by the user,
 * as well as the phase, which determines the start index of the sine wave.
 * 
 * The phase can also be set, which determines the offset of the frequency.
 * So, for example, you can set the index to 10 instead of starting at 0.
 * We determine the index at a given time by dividing by the sampling rate.
