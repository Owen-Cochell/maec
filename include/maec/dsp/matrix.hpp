 * This header contains matrix and common matrix operations
 * that may be useful in DSP contexts.
 * These implementations are very basic!
 * These are no replacements for mature linear algebra libraries.
 * The speed of these operations are also probably not ideal,
 * so it is not recommended to use these components in realtime scenarios.
