 * A "Fourier Transform" is an operation that decomposes

 * (j being the imaginary component)
 * Which expands out to this:
 *
 * real = cos(sign * 2 * k * PI / size)

/**
 * @brief Processes forward and backward FFT data.
 *
 * When processing real data in the FFT
 * (placing even values in real component and odd in imaginary),
 * it is necessary to preform some processing steps to ensure
 * output data is what we expect.
 *
 * The forward processing formula is as follows:
 *
 * O(k) = X[k] * A(k) + X*[N - k] * B(k)
 *
 * The inverse (backwards) processing formula is as follows:
 *
 * O(k) = X[k] * A*(k) + X*[N - k] * B*(k)
 *
 * Where k is the frequency component,
 * N is the size of the of the data
 * (that is, the size of the data after real/odd ordering, which is 2N in size),
 * and A/B are the coefficients, which are documented above.
 * 
 * This method should be called when working with frequency information
 * of real data that has been ran through the FFT.
 * After sending the frequency info of complex valued data through the forward FFT,
 * then it should be sent through this method.
 * Before sending the frequency info of the complex valued data through the inverse FFT,
 * then it should be sent through this method.
 * 
 * The data to be provided MUST have the size of (N / 2) + 1
 * (again, N is the size of the data before real/odd ordering).
 * This can be calculated by sending the size through the 'ft_size()' function.
 * You also need to provide if you want to do a forward or inverse operation,
 * simply pass false for forward, and true for backward.
 * This method also works in place!
 *
 * @tparam T Type of complex data
 * @param complex Iterator of complex data
 * @param size Size of complex data before real/odd ordering
 * @param invert true for backward operation, false for forward operation
