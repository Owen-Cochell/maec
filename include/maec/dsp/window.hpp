 * 
 * In DSP a window function is a function that is zero-valued
 * outside of a choosen interval.
 * Mathematically, these functions are designed
 * to remove all components outside of an interval,
 * and the contents that overlap are tapered to the 
 * contents of the function.
 * When multiplying signals to these functions,
 * the result is the tapered overlapping content,
 * thus allowing you to 'view through the window!'
 * 
 * Practically, window functions are just used for tapering,
 * and are not often used for selecting values in an interval.
 * 
 * We provide some useful window functions that can compute
 * values at any given point!
 * Sometimes, we offer window functions that expose parameters
 * that can alter how these windows are generated.
 * However, this is incompatible with maec kernel functions,
 * which expect only two int parameters, the current value and total size.
 * We provide two implementations of these functions,
 * allowing you to use the defaults easily with maec kernels,
 * and configure the windows to your needs.

/**
 * @brief Generates a Hann window
 *
 * This function generates a Hann window,
 * which is described by the following equation:
 *
 * w(n) = a0 - (1 - a0) * cos(2 * PI * num / size)
 *
 * A Hann window has a0 set to 0.5,
 * but this is configurable.
 * This produces a taper formed by using a raised cosine or 
 * sine-squared with ends that touch zero.
 *
 * @param num Current value to compute
 * @param size Size of the window
 * @param a0 a0 value to be used in above equation
 * @return long double Computed value

 *
 * This function generates a Hamming window,

 * w(n) = a0 - (1 - a0) * cos(2 * PI * num / size)
 *
 * A Hamming window has a0 set to 0.54,
 * but this is configurable.
 * This produces a taper formed by using a raised cosine with 
 * non-zero endpoints, optimized to minimize the nearest side lobe.

 *
 * Where:
 *
 * a0 = (1 - alpha) / 2
 * a1 = 1 / 2
 * a2 = alpha / 2
 *
 * A blackman has an alpha value of 0.16,
 * but this is configurable.
 * This produces a taper formed by using the first three 
 * terms of a summation of cosines
