Modular Audio Engine in C++

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress!
This project will remain in an experimental state for a long time.
Any components or features may change in a massive way with no warning.
Use at your own risk.

## Theory

In theory, this project will provide modules that can be chained
together to produce/ work with audio data.
This can be anything ranging from generating audio data from scratch
to playing back audio data.

This project takes a lot of inspiration from modular analog synthesizers,
which provided a very simple yet powerful way to work with audio data.

When completed, this project will contain modules for generating/playing back audio data,
altering audio data (filters and whatnot), and outputting this data to multiple sources and backends.
This project is geared towards realtime audio playback and analysis.
